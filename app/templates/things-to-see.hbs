      <span class="location-name"><a href="http://www.diaart.org/visit/visit/diabeacon-beacon-united-states">Dia Beacon</a></span> (3 Beekman St. Beacon, NY): This modern art installation features an impressive array of large sculptures and paintings. If twisted metal, broken glass, dramatic scale, and experimental abstract art sound like your cup of tea, this is a neat place to spend a few hours. Coffee and gift shops on-site.

      <span class="location-name"><a href="http://stormking.org/">Storm King Art Center</a></span> (1 Museum Rd. New Windsor, NY): Similar to Dia Beacon in terms of artistic style, but a better bet if you prefer outdoor art. This expansive property is beautiful and features massive outdoor sculptures and a dramatic landscape that is excellent for a long walk. Sneakers or other sturdy walking shoes recommended.

      <span class="location-name"><a href="http://www.vassar.edu/">Vassar College</a></span> (124 Raymond Ave. Poughkeepsie, NY): It’s a bit of a drive, but we couldn’t resist throwing this on here. In addition to being a wonderful liberal arts college, Vassar boasts an absolutely beautiful campus that also happens to be an arboretum. If you’re looking to catch lunch in the area as part of your visit, definitely consider stopping at Babycakes Cafe, a favorite spot of ours from our college days!
