<p>We met at Vassar College, during our first semester in the Fall of 2007 (we took biology together). We celebrate our dating anniversary as October 28, the same as our wedding date! We graduated in 2011 with degrees in history (Elizabeth) and computer science (Alex).</p>
<p>After college, we moved to Medford, Massachusetts so Elizabeth could pursue her Masters in history at Tufts University. Alex took a job as a programmer at iVantage Health Analytics, a healthcare analytics company. After finishing her Masters in 2013, Elizabeth started working in editorial operations at UpToDate, an online journal for physicians; we then moved to Allston, a suburb of Boston.

2016 was a big year for us; on May 21st, we got engaged at Worlds End in Hingham, MA. In August, Alex was hired at Rallypoint Networks, Inc, an online community for military veterans and active duty personnel.

<p>As a couple, we enjoy board games and card games, birdwatching, golf, hiking, and running. We also enjoy cooking and dining out.</p>
